= Description

[Yul](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html) is an intermediate language that is part of the [solidity
compiler](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/). It is by-design aspiring to be compiled to bytecode for different
backends, while at the moment it is for [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) (EVM).

This module provides an "Embedded (in Haskell) Domain Specific Language" (eDSL) for programming in Yul, called 'YulCat'.

YulCat is based on category theory. The objects in this category are instances of 'YulCatObj'.

Further more, the 'YulCat' is instantiated as a "Symmetric Monoidal Category" (SMC). Being a SMC enables the possibility
for compiling linearly-typed functions in Haskell directly to the 'YulCat', where linear-types can provide additional
safety to the practice of EVM programming.
